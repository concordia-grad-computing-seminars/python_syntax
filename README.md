# python_syntax
A set of Jupyter notebooks that introduce the basics of Python- from "Hello World" to object-oriented coding.

These simple notebooks walk through the basics of Python syntax to help new
users learn the language. The primers are a *living* set of tutorials that are
under consistent development to help improve and expand the material.

The tutorials are listed below; just click and read.

For more information about the tutorial source code, including contributing,
see [documentation of the source code](docs/README.md).


## GETTING STARTED
A standard Python3 environment is needed to run these tutorials.
This includes Python3, Numpy, and Matplotlib.

## THE TUTORIALS
### Language Basics
The following tutorials contain information about the base language.
This includes variable types, general language behavior, file I/O,
object-oriented behavior, and more. For new Pythonistas, running through
each of these in order is critical.
